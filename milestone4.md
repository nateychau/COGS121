User Action 1: For Milestone 4, we have updated the backend to be functional and connected to the front end in that account information can be added to a firebase database, displayed, and deleted. This also allows the user to link this information to the results page andt allows the user to immediately add and see the other users (instructors) tracked in the database as well as delete them from the database.

User Action 2: The second user action implemented in Milestone 4 is a Google Maps API which can display the userâ€™s current address or search up addresses. This will eventually be used in helping instructors post their location or help potential customers find the desired instructor, which is very useful for coordinating piano lessons/tutoring.
